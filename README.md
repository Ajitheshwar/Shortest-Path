# Shortest-Paths

It is application where we select a grid of size **m** rows and **n** columns.<br>
We must select start and end poisitions in the grid.<br>
We can add walls in the remaining grid.<br>
Based on the available paths from start to end, all shortest possible paths are highlighted.<br><br>

## Check below link for the application<br>

## Skills I have used
HTML, CSS, JS

## Algorithm 
I have used Dynamic Programming and knowledge of Dijkstra Algoithm to find the shortest path.
Then I have traced the paths.
